# Restaurant Page Project

This project is a simple, multi-page restaurant website built using modern JavaScript and bundled with Webpack. It demonstrates fundamental front-end development concepts, including module bundling, DOM manipulation, and basic routing (tab switching).

## What You Will Learn

By exploring this project, you will gain practical experience with:

* **Webpack:** Setting up and configuring Webpack as a module bundler to manage JavaScript, HTML, and potentially other assets.
* **`package.json`:** Initializing and understanding the role of `package.json` in managing project dependencies and scripts.
* **.gitignore:** Configuring a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (like `node_modules` and the `dist` build output) from version control.
* **HTML Structure:** Creating a basic HTML skeleton with a header, navigation, and a dedicated content area.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically creating and manipulating HTML elements using JavaScript to build the website's content.
* **JavaScript Modules:** Organizing code into separate, reusable modules for different sections of the website (e.g., homepage, menu, contact).
* **Import and Export:** Utilizing JavaScript's `import` and `export` statements to share functionality between modules.
* **Event Handling:** Implementing event listeners to handle user interactions, specifically button clicks for tab switching.
* **Basic Routing (Tab Switching):** Implementing client-side "routing" by dynamically updating the content area based on user navigation.
* **Deployment to GitHub Pages:** Learning a specific workflow to deploy a Webpack-bundled project to GitHub Pages by pushing the contents of the `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.
