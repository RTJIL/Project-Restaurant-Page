        At Leaf & Lore, salads are whispered secrets on plates. Tonight, cynical
        critic Marlowe storms in—armed with pen, palate, and skepticism. Before
        she can sneer, a bowl arrives: emerald leaves shimmering like forgotten
        memories. She crunches. Suddenly, childhood summers and her
        grandfather’s crooked grin flood back. Her pen trembles. Across the
        table, tableside spinner chimes: “You don’t choose us—we choose you.”
        She meets its gaze: a winking tomato slice perched on arugula. Marlowe
        chokes on laughter and tears. The gimmick is real magic. As she
        scribbles a rave, the chef shrugs: “Greens are the new truth serum.” Dig
        in, hun.
